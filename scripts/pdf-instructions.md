## Alternative: Sample Questions
If extracting all 120 questions is too time-consuming, please provide:
- 5 sample questions from each section (25 total)
- With their answers and explanations
- I can then generate realistic dummy data for the remaining questions

## What I'll Do With This Data:
1. Parse all questions into structured format
2. Create a demo mock test in the database
3. Generate sample student attempts with various scores
4. Create AI-powered analysis and recommendations
5. Test all 16 pages of the framework with real data

Please start by sharing whatever is easiest for you - even a few sample questions from each section would help me create a complete demo!
